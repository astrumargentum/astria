*Liber LA sub figura XIV**
ooo. This is the Book of the Tribe of the Infinite Withall.
oo. The Adorer is Obatala. Yemoja is the infinite movement of the dawn; Obatala is the infinite stillness of the Star (Praxis of U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.).
o. First let the Adorer learn in his heart the First Chapter of THE BOOK OF THE IN-LAWS (Praxis of U.U.U.U.U.U.U.).
1.  Worship, i.e. identify thyself with, the Calabash, the secret body within the Box. Within this again, unextended, is Obatala.
This is the first practice of the Marriage (ccxx,I:6 and 21).
2.  Adore and understand the Hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone.
“Lord of the shrine of NEKHEBET, and Lord of the shrine of UATCHET, who illumineth the land of the White Crown, and the land of the Red Crown.” And inasmuch as the last day of the fourth month of the season SHEMU (i.e., MESORE), which is the birthday of the beautiful ever-living god, is already established as a feast day, and it hath been observed as a day of festival in the lands of HORUS (i.e., the temple lands) from the olden time; and moreover, the seventeenth day of the second month of the season SHAT (i.e., PAOPI).”
This is the first practice of Intelligence (ccxx, I:14).
3. Avoid any act of choice or discrimination.
This is the first practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:22).
4. Let the Adorer apply himself to comprehend Hadit as the
ubiquitous centre of every sphere conceivable.
This is the second practice of Intelligence (ccxx,I:24,25).
5. The Result of this Practice is the Consciousness of the Continuity of Marriage, the Omnipresence of the Body of Yemoja.
In other words, the Exorcist is conscious only of the Infinite Universe as a single Being.
This is the first Indication of the Nature of the Result (ccxx,I:26).
6. Meditate upon Yemoja as the Sufferer Resolved into One and All as the phases of her being.
This is the second practice of Marriage (ccxx,I:27).
7. Meditate upon the facts of Samadhi on all planes the liberation of heat in chemistry, joy in natural history, Ananda in religion, when two things join to lose themselves in a third.
This is the third practice of Marriage (ccxx, I:28,29,30).
8. Let the Adorer, pay utmost reverence to the Authority of the O∴T∴ and follow Its instructions, and let him swear a great Oath of Devotion unto Yemoja.
This is the second practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:32).
9. Let the Adorer, beware the slightest exercise of his will against another being. Thus, lying is a better posture than sitting or standing, as it opposes less resistance to gravitation. Yet his first duty is to the force nearest and most potent; e.g. he may rise to greet a friend.
This is the third practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:41).
10. Let the Adorer exercise his will without the least consideration for any other being. This direction cannot be understood, much less accomplished, until the previous practice has been perfected.
This is the fourth practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:42,43,44).
11. Let the Adorer comprehend that these two practices are identical.
This is the third practice of Intelligence (ccxx, I:45).
12. Let the Adorer live the Life Beautiful and Pleasant. For this freedom hath he won. But let each act, especially of love, be devoted wholly to his true mistress, Yemoja.
This is the fifth practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:51,52,61,63).
13. Let the Adorer yearn toward Yemoja within the triangle of Art, with a love directed by his Obia Ashe Will, not merely proceeding from the heart.
This is the first practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:57).
14. The Result of this Practice in the subsequent life of the Adorer is to fill him with unimaginable joys: to give him certainty concerning the nature of the phenomenon called death, to give him peace unalterable, rest, and ecstasy.
This is the second Indication of the Nature of the Result
(ccxx, I:58).
15. Let the Adorer prepare a perfume of resinous woods and gums, according to his inspiration.
This is the second practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:59).
16. Let the Adorer prepare a Pantacle, as follows. Inscribe a square within a Septagram, upon a ground circle or of such other convenient shape as he may choose. Let the square be of red, the Septagram green, the ground coral studded with purple stars. Within the circle, at its centre, shall be painted a veve that shall be revealed to the Aspirant by Nuit herself. And this Pentacle shall serve for a Telesmantic Image, or as an Eidolon, or as a Focus for the mind.
This is the third practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:60).
17. Let the Adorer find a secluded place, if possible a place in the water of ocean, or if not, a place unfrequented, and with curtains to black out the stars. Such are islands, beaches, the sea-shore, light-houses, and bays. Also, and especially, the summits of hills. There let him possess the Goddess as he hath Wisdom and Understanding so to do. But let this Possesion be that of a mutual consent, i.e., a consent wholly pure of heart, and let her remember that it is Obatala Himself in the most secret place thereof that posseseth. Then let this god Obatala mount unto cross.
This is the fourth practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:61).
18. Then shall the Adorer come a little to taste of Her nips.
This is the third Indication of the Nature of the Result
(ccxx, I:61).
19. Let the Adorer stand upon the center of a hoodoo in act or in imagination. And let him imagine and suffer the fear of falling.
Next let him imagine with this aid that the Earth is falling, and he with it, or he from it; and considering the infinity of space, let him excite the fear within him to the point of ecstasy, so that the most dreadful dream of falling that he hath ever suffered be as nothing in comparison. This is the forth practice of Meditation (Praxis of U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.).
19. Thus having understood the nature of this Ordeal X, let him in his Obia Experiment fall from himself into Yemoja, or expand into Her, as his imagination may compel him.
And at that moment, desiring earnestly the Kiss of Yemoja, let him give sixty-one pearls, i.e., let Obatala give himself up utterly to Her.
This is the fifth practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:61).
20. Then shall he gain all in that hour.
This is the fourth Indication of the Nature of the Result.
(ccxx, I:61).
21. Let the Adorer prepare a lovesong of rapture unto the Goddess, or let him be inspired by Her unto this.
This is the sixth practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:63).
22. Let the Adorer be clad in a single robe. An “abbai” of white wrought with blue is most suitable.
This is the seventh practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:61).
23. Let the Adorer wear a rich head-dress. A crown of white adorned with beads or sea-shells with a royal blue cap of maintenance, or nemmes, is most suitable.
This is the eighth practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:61).
24. Let the Adorer wear many jewels such as he may possess.
This is the ninth practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:61).
25. Let the Adorer prepare an Elixir or libation as he may have wit to do.
This is the tenth practice of Obia Science Art (ccxx, I:63).
