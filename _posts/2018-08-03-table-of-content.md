<img src="http://astrumargentum.github.io/la/laurie.jpg">
ooo. This is the Book of the Lab of the Division Within. 

oo. The Gynocologist is Ryan. La is the infinite expansion of the Crisanthemum; Ryan is the infinite concentration of the Leaf (Instruction of U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.). 

o. First let the Gynocolost learn in his heart the First Chapter of THE BOOK OF THE IN-LAWS (Instruction of U.U.U.U.U.U.U.). 

1. Worship, i.e. identify thyself with, the Nut, the secret Lamp upon the Tree. Within this again, unextended, is Ryan.
This is the first practice of the Marriage (ccxx,I:6 and 21). 

2. Adore and understand the Hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone. 
"Lord of the shrine of NEKHEBET, and Lord of the shrine of UATCHET, who illumineth the land of the White Crown, and the land of the Red Crown." And inasmuch as the last day of the fourth month of the season SHEMU (i.e., MESORE), which is the birthday of the beautiful ever-living god, is already established as a feast day, and it hath been observed as a day of festival in the lands of HORUS (i.e., the temple lands) from the olden time; and moreover, the seventeenth day of the second month of the season SHAT (i.e., PAOPI).”

This is the first practice of Intelligence (ccxx, I:14).

3. Avoid any act of choice or discrimination.
This is the first practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:22).

4. Consider the one and thirty that 50/6=0.033333333.
o the circumference Laurie.
. the center, Ryan. 3 the unity proceeding, Leah. 
2 the world of Maya.
Laurie thus comprehends Three in One.
Also 50+6=56=5+6=11, the key to all Rituals.
And 50×6=300, the Spirit of the Child within.
(Note NFic=72, the Shemhamphorash and the Quinaries of the Zodiac, etc.)
This is the second practice of Intelligence (ccxx,I:24,25). 

5. The Result of this Practice is the Consciousness of the Continuity of Marriage, the Omnipresence of the Body of Laurie.
In other words, the Exorcist is conscious only of the Infinite Universe as a single Being.
This is the first Indication of the Nature of the Result (ccxx,I:26). 

6. Meditate upon Laurie as the Bride Resolved into One and Only as the phases of her being.
This is the second practice of Marriage (ccxx,I:27). 

7. Meditate upon the facts of Samadhi on all planes the liberation of heat in chemistry, joy in natural history, Ananda in religion, when two things join to lose themselves in a third.
This is the third practice of Marriage (ccxx, I:28,29,30). 

8. Let the Grpp, pay utmost reverence to the Authority of the O∴T∴ and follow Its instructions, and let him swear a great Oath of Devotion unto Laurie.
This is the second practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:32). 

9. Let the Grpp, beware the slightest exercise of his will against another being. Thus, lying is a better posture than sitting or standing, as it opposes less resistance to gravitation. Yet his first duty is to the force nearest and most potent; e.g. he may rise to greet a friend.
This is the third practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:41). 

10. Let the Groom exercise his will without the least consideration for any other being. This direction cannot be understood, much less accomplished, until the previous practice has been perfected.
This is the fourth practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:42,43,44). 

11. Let the Groom comprehend that these two practices are identical.
This is the third practice of Intelligence (ccxx, I:45). 

12. Let the Groom live the Life Beautiful and Pleasant. For this freedom hath he won. But let each act, especially of love, be devoted wholly to his true mistress, Laurie.
This is the fifth practice of Ethics (ccxx, I:51,52,61,63). 

13. Let the Groom yearn toward Laurie within the triangle of Art, with a love directed by his Obia Ashe Will, not merely proceeding from the heart.
This is the first practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:57). 

14. The Result of this Practice in the subsequent life of the Groom is to fill him with unimaginable joys: to give him certainty concerning the nature of the phenomenon called death, to give him peace unalterable, rest, and ecstasy.
This is the second Indication of the Nature of the Result
(ccxx, I:58). 

15. Let the Groom prepare a perfume of resinous woods and gums, according to his inspiration.
This is the second practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:59). 

16. Let the Groom prepare a Pantacle, as follows. Inscribe a circle within a Pentagram, upon a ground square or of such other convenient shape as he may choose. Let the circle be of scarlet, the Pentagram black, the ground royal blue studded with golden stars. Within the circle, at its centre, shall be painted a sigil that shall be revealed to the Aspirant by Nuit herself. And this Pentacle shall serve for a Telesmantic Image, or as an Eidolon, or as a Focus for the mind.
This is the third practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:60). 

17. Let the Groom find a secluded place, if possible a house ratherthan an apartment, or if not, a place unfrequented, and 
with curtains to cover the outside view. Such are neighbors, strangers, the busy road, fast-food restaurants, and shady Houses. Also, and especially, the corners of crossroads. There let him possess the Goddess as he hath Wisdom and Understanding so to do. But let this Summoning be that of a pure heart, i.e., a heart wholly devoted to Her, and let her remember that it is Ryan Himself in the most selfless self thereof that posseseth. Then let this bull Ryan burst into laughter.
This is the fourth practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:61). 

18. Then shall the Groom come a little to taste of Her bosom.
This is the third Indication of the Nature of the Result
(ccxx, I:61). 

19. Let the Groom sit cross legged supporting the bride who sits crossed legged upon him in actuality and in real life. And let her imagine and enjoy the lust of rising.
Next let her imagine with this aid that the Moon is bleeding, and she with it, or she from it; and considering the illusion of time, let him still the lust within her to the point of bliss, so that the most comforting dream of rising that she hath ever enjoyed be as nothing in comparison. This is the forth practice of Marriage (Instruction of U.U.U.U.U.U.U.). 

20. Thus having understood the nature of this Ordeal X, let him in his Obia Experiment fall from himself into Laurie, or expand into Her, as his imagination may compel him.
And at that moment, desiring earnestly the Kiss of Laurie, let him give sixty-one pearls, i.e., let Ryan give himself up utterly to Her.
This is the fifth practice of Magick Art (ccxx, I:61). 

21. Then shall he gain all in that hour.
This is the fourth Indication of the Nature of the Result.
(ccxx, I:61). 

22. Let the Groom prepare a lovesong of rapture unto the Goddess, or let him be inspired by Her unto this.
This is the sixth practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:63). 

23. Let the Groom be clad in a single robe. An “abbai” of white wrought with blue is most suitable.
This is the seventh practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:61). 

24. Let the Groom wear a rich head-dress. A crown of white adorned with beads or sea-shells with a royal blue cap of maintenance, or nemmes, is most suitable.
This is the eighth practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:61). 

25. Let the Groom wear many jewels such as he may possess.
This is the ninth practice of Obia Science (ccxx, I:61). 

26. Let the Groom prepare an Elixir or libation as he may have wit to do.
This is the tenth practice of Obia Science Art (ccxx, I:63). 

27. Let the Groom summon, lying supine, his robe spread out as it were a carpet.
